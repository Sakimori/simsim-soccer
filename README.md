# simsim soccer discord bot

blaseball, blaseball, is **soccer!** in an unofficial capacity. this project is also completely unaffiliated with the game band.

we will have custom players (generated by onomancer), custom teams, custom leagues, all set up in discord and watchable at <url pending! 

if you would like to add <bot name to your server to be able to set up teams and games, you can do so with this link: <bot link

accepting pull requests, check the issues for to-dos.

## FAQ (this FAQ is a work in progress and will be expanded over time):
- Q: Why have the teams in my league played an uneven amount of games/why are some teams not scheduled for games for some weeks?  
  A: Scheduling algorithms are really hard and the way xvi chose to do it involves some teams having byes for some series of the season, it'll even out by the end and every team will play the same number of games.
  
- Q: My league stopped playing randomly and I don't know why, what should I do?  
  A: There were probably server issues or a patch went out, use the startleague command again and things should resume from where they left off.

- Q: What should I do if my question isn't answered by this FAQ, this readme, or the help text for the commands, or I find a bug?  
  A: Please submit your issue or bug to this form and Artemis will pass it along if it's something we can do anything about. https://forms.gle/PjbpfT46yuMDGca46
